# [104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## 1. 题目描述(简单)

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note**: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its depth = 3.
```
