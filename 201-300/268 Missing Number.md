## [268. Missing Number](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/missing-number/)

## 1. 题目描述(简单)

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
**Note:**
- Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
