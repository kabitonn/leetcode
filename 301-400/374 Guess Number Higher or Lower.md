## [374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

## 1. 题目描述(简单)

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

> -1 : My number is lower
>  1 : My number is higher
>  0 : Congrats! You got it!

Example :
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```
