## [429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

## 1. 题目描述(简单)

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example, given a 3-ary tree:

 



```
We should return its level order traversal:

[
     [1],
     [3,2,4],
     [5,6]
]
``` 

**Note:**

1. The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
2. The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
